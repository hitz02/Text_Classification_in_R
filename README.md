# Text Classification in R

A simple implementation of text classification on a highly unbalanced dataset.

A quick snapshot of what you can expect -
1. Text preprocessing in R using 'tm' library
2. Vectorization of pre-processed text using Keras text vectorization layer
3. Training neural nets based classifier using Keras layers
4. Creating Document term matrix from text and removing sparsity
5. Using document term matrix as features set for classification
6. Using boosted model to train the classifier
7. Evaluating the model on the test set at different thresholds
